## JavaScript behind the process.

### 1. How JavaScript Works?

JavaScript is Synchronous & Single-threaded language. Everything in javascript happens inside of an execution context.

Execution context is a container that defines the environment where JavaScript code is executed. The Execution context decides which code section has access to the codes variables, functions and objects.

Figure of Execution context:
------------------------------------------------------------------
|  Memory / Variable Environment  |  Code / Thread of Execution  |
------------------------------------------------------------------
| Key: Value (Pairs)              |  []                          |
|                                 |  ______________              |
|  a: 10                          |  []                          |
|  fn: {...}                      |  ______________              |
|_________________________________|______________________________|

variables and functions are stored in memory compartment as key value pairs. In the code compartment a single command of javascript are executed in a specific order.
